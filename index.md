<h1>About</h1>

{% include image.html url="/images/profile-image-2.jpg" width=225 align="left" %}

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of
Colorado (CU), Boulder. My background is in Programming Languages and
Formal Methods. My research is driven by the curiousity to apply PL
and FM way of thinking to solve hard problems in other domains of
Computer Science, such as Distributed Systems, Databases, and
Artificial Intelligence. In my current research, I am exploring how
provably-correct and scalable distributed applications can be built
with least amount of programming effort. The research has practical
implications to the up and coming area of decentralized trustless
computing.

Prior to joining CU, I was a Post-Doc and a Ph.D student at Purdue
University, where I was advised by [Prof. Suresh
Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh).  As a grad
student, I was a [Google PhD
Fellow](https://research.googleblog.com/2018/04/announcing-2018-google-phd-fellows-for.html)
in the area of Programming Technology and Software Engineering. I
earned my Masters in CS from Purdue, and Bachelors in CS from [BITS
Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in), India.

<span class="highlight">I am actively recruiting Ph.D students</span>.
If you are a graduate student at CU with a strong motivation do
research, please drop me an email; I'll reply as quickly as I can. If
you are a prospective student, I strongly encourage you to apply to
CU!  We have a great [PLV](https://plv.colorado.edu) group, and one of
the [best
campuses](https://www.colorado.edu/virtualvisit/boulder-campus) among
US universities.
